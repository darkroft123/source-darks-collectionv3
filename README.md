## Build Instructions

### IMPORTANT:

For build instructions go to [BUILD.md](https://github.com/Vortex2Oblivion/LeatherEngine-Extended-Support/blob/main/build/BUILD.md)

## Features

> 1-21+ Key Support

What does this mean? Well, now if you want, you can choose a different amount of arrows / keys! (Aka different from 4), this feature goes up to 21 by default, but can be increased with mods (no source code required).

> Full mod support with Polymod (with a mod loader)!

Support for custom songs, characters, stages, weeks, cutscenes (dialogue, and video), all without modifying the source code! All you have to do is follow a guide that I will be making in the future and then you can make as many mods as you want!

> Custom Cutscenes

Dialogue and video cutscenes can now be used without coding them in! (Although, in the future you will have the option to manually code them)

> Custom Note Types

You can have different note types that give different amounts of health or give damage on hit. They can be more advanced if you want however, since modcharts can access what note type the last note hit was.

> More to come...
